# Simple Chess
Chess Game in Java using Eclipse IDE

This is a simple implementation of a chess game in Java using the Eclipse IDE. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and allows a human player to play against the computer.

# Game

To make a move, click on the piece you want to move and then click on the square where you want to move the piece. If the move is legal, the piece will be moved to the new square. The computer will make its move after you make yours.

The program will check for checkmate and stalemate conditions after each move, and display a message if the game is over.

# Features and Limitations
This implementation of chess has some limitations but offers many features, including:

# Features:
The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows a human player to play against the computer.
The game enforces the rules of chess, including castling, en passant, promotion, and checkmate/stalemate conditions.
The program highlights the squares that a piece can move to when it is selected.

# Limitations:
The program does not save the game state, so it is not possible to resume a game after exiting the program.
The program does not implement any time controls or game timers.  
The program does not have game modes to select from. The player can only go against the computer, for now.
